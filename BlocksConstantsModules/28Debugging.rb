# since objects can be converted to strings, logging helps in debugging.
# Another way is the interactive debugging, by adding breakpoints.

# from commandline, using library debug.rb
# ruby -r debug runner.rb (runner is the code)
# next <n> executes the next n lines.
# p <var> prints the variable var value.
